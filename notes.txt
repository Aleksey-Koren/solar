        1.2 Should be able to put up for sale/remove from sale goods

    2   2.1 Add columns to goods table: buy_price Long default 0 ; available for sale boolean ; available for buy boolean
        2.2 Alter column price to sell_price
        2.3. Refactor goods mapper, entity and dto

    3   StationController.updateGoods().

    4   Refactor productShopFacade logic after above changes.



    Questions to Roma:
    1. applyModification(). Where should be placed? (witch controller?).
    2. fields validation. Can we use Hibernate validator?
